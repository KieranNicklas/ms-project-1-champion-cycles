This will allows the user to request different pages of the website without the need to use the 'back' button on the browser.

The four landing page images provide an alternative ability to load different pages, or different areas of the page, and these links are unique to the Home page. The links allow the user to change to the Range page and Support page like the main navigation bar, but also the About Us section and Contact Us section. Each link includes a related background image which best represents the section the user will be taken to. 

- About Us
The about us section provides information on the reasoning behind leasing a bicycle in comparison of purchasing a bike, and the reasoning behind using Capital Cycles.

The contact us section provides an opportunity for the user to reach out to Capital Cycles to enquire about a bike found on the Range page. The user can select a bike from the drop down option, and send an enquiry with return contact details to start the process of the lease.

- The Range Page
The range page consists of all the bicycles that the company can provide as part of a lease. Each bicycle image consists of the full name as detailed on the Decathlon website (https://www.decathlon.co.uk/) and a brief description of the bike. This will allow the user to get a brief idea of the style of bicycle that they wish to use. An additional feature to this mode will be the introduction of greater detail of the individual bicycles, and the option to the expand the image of the bicycle.

This page consists of links to basic video tutorials to enable the user to solve problems without the need to take the bike to a garage or shop.
